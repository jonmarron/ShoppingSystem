Shopping System:

I want an online shopping system where customers can browse products, make orders, and check out.
Each product should have a product ID, name and a price.
For statistic purpose we would like to know how often a product was bought
Products can be of the type technical, food or cloth
Customers should have a name, address, and email. Orders should have an order ID, date, and total price.
Create a function that retrieves all products with a price less than a certain amount.
Create a function that shows which customer spent the most in the last month
Create a function that checks which product was bought mostly
